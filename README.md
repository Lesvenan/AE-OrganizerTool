I have two words for you today : **Clean Projects**.

Raise your hand if you ever encounter a really messy project... 
Well, I have good news for you because today is the day that this nightmare end.

## What does this script do?
Now, you will be able to **reorganize a project panel in a click**. The script creates a generic folder structure, and put all the files, precomps and composition in the right folder.

And to make more efficient you can rename files with key prefix or suffix so it goes in the right subfolder 
> For example, a precomp with a prefix such as : CTA / LOGO / APP / COPY... will be stored automatically in the "Working Comps" folder, and while the others precomps will just be in the "Pre Comps" folder.
> Also, an audio file named "VO_English" will be stored in "VO" folder, while a file named "En_OrderNow" will just be in the "Audio" folder.

You can also **clean your compositions by trimming automatically the selected layer** accordingly to :
- the first and/or last scale keyframes
- the first and/or last opacity keyframes
- the in and/or out point of the alpha parented layer
- the first and/or last selected properties keyframes

Or by **deleting all the useless layers**
> Meaning : that are nor enabled, nor a parent of other layers, nor locked, nor used as an alpha matte.

Or by **Putting all the audio files with no video enabled at the bottom** of the composition
